Identity Function

1. Prove for empty List:

fmap id []          = id []
use [].fmap.2
id fmap []          = id []
use [].fmap.1
id []               = id []

So we know that it works for the empty list case

2.
fmap id xs          = id xs
use [].fmap.2
id xs: fmap id xs   = id xs
use id.1
id xs : fmap id xs  = id xs
